	printf( "D-LINK DWL-2000AP+ with firmware version 2.11 is prone to two remote denial\n\
of service vulnerability because it fails to handle arp flooding. \n\
The first vuln causes the wireless link (802.11) to be resetted and the arp \n\
table to be rebuilded. All clients connected to the AP are disconnected.\n\
This bug can be triggered by sending lots of arp replies through the wired link\n\
or the radio one at a very high speed.\n\
The second vulnerability affects the wireless link only and are quite harder\n\
to trigger but causes the AP firmware to crash making a manual reboot mandatory.\n\
This bug can be triggered only if no other D-LINK ethernet products are visible \n\
to AP, if wep encryption is enabled and it needs a very large amount of\n\
arp-requests to be broadcasted through its wireless link at a very high speed. \n\
This exploit works in the 90%% of cases because sometimes the AP is able to ban\n\
the flooding client before the exploiting process is complete.\n\
D-LINK doesn't support this product anymore so no solution is available.\n\
Other products can be vulnerable.\n\
\n\
Not vulnerable: DWL-700AP\n\n");
