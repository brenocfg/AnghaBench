	 * The next few lines have given us lots of grief...
	 *
	 * Why are we testing PMD* at this top level?  Because often
	 * there will be no work to do at all, and we'd prefer not to
	 * go all the way down to the bottom just to discover that.
	 *
	 * Why all these "- 1"s?  Because 0 represents both the bottom
	 * of the address space and the top of it (using -1 for the
	 * top wouldn't help much: the masks would do the wrong thing).
	 * The rule is that addr 0 and floor 0 refer to the bottom of
	 * the address space, but end 0 and ceiling 0 refer to the top
	 * Comparisons need to use "end - 1" and "ceiling - 1" (though
	 * that end 0 case should be mythical).
	 *
	 * Wherever addr is brought up or ceiling brought down, we must
	 * be careful to reject "the opposite 0" before it confuses the
	 * subsequent tests.  But what about where end is brought down
	 * by PMD_SIZE below? no, end can't go down to 0 there.
	 *
	 * Whereas we round start (addr) and ceiling down, by different
	 * masks at different levels, in order to test whether a table
	 * now has no other vmas using it, so can be freed, we don't
	 * bother to round floor or end up - the tests don't need that.
