  /* There are several targets (IA-64, PowerPC, and others) which
     don't represent pointers to functions as simply the address of
     the function's entry point.  For example, on the IA-64, a
     function pointer points to a two-word descriptor, generated by
     the linker, which contains the function's entry point, and the
     value the IA-64 "global pointer" register should have --- to
     support position-independent code.  The linker generates
     descriptors only for those functions whose addresses are taken.

     On such targets, it's difficult for GDB to convert an arbitrary
     function address into a function pointer; it has to either find
     an existing descriptor for that function, or call malloc and
     build its own.  On some targets, it is impossible for GDB to
     build a descriptor at all: the descriptor must contain a jump
     instruction; data memory cannot be executed; and code memory
     cannot be modified.

     Upon entry to this function, if VAL is a value of type `function'
     (that is, TYPE_CODE (VALUE_TYPE (val)) == TYPE_CODE_FUNC), then
     VALUE_ADDRESS (val) is the address of the function.  This is what
     you'll get if you evaluate an expression like `main'.  The call
     to COERCE_ARRAY below actually does all the usual unary
     conversions, which includes converting values of type `function'
     to `pointer to function'.  This is the challenging conversion
     discussed above.  Then, `unpack_long' will convert that pointer
     back into an address.

     So, suppose the user types `disassemble foo' on an architecture
     with a strange function pointer representation, on which GDB
     cannot build its own descriptors, and suppose further that `foo'
     has no linker-built descriptor.  The address->pointer conversion
     will signal an error and prevent the command from running, even
     though the next step would have been to convert the pointer
     directly back into the same address.

     The following shortcut avoids this whole mess.  If VAL is a
     function, just return its address directly.  */

     addresses onto a single large unified address space.  For
     instance: An architecture may consider a large integer in the
     range 0x10000000 .. 0x1000ffff to already represent a data
     addresses (hence not need a pointer to address conversion) while
     a small integer would still need to be converted integer to
     pointer to address.  Just assume such architectures handle all
     integer conversions in a single function.  */

     I think INTEGER_TO_ADDRESS is a good idea as proposed --- but we
     must admonish GDB hackers to make sure its behavior matches the
     compiler's, whenever possible.

     In general, I think GDB should evaluate expressions the same way
     the compiler does.  When the user copies an expression out of
     their source code and hands it to a `print' command, they should
     get the same value the compiler would have computed.  Any
     deviation from this rule can cause major confusion and annoyance,
     and needs to be justified carefully.  In other words, GDB doesn't
     really have the freedom to do these conversions in clever and
     useful ways.

     AndrewC pointed out that users aren't complaining about how GDB
     casts integers to pointers; they are complaining that they can't
     take an address from a disassembly listing and give it to `x/i'.
     This is certainly important.

     Adding an architecture method like INTEGER_TO_ADDRESS certainly
     makes it possible for GDB to "get it right" in all circumstances
     --- the target has complete control over how things get done, so
     people can Do The Right Thing for their target without breaking
     anyone else.  The standard doesn't specify how integers get
     converted to pointers; usually, the ABI doesn't either, but
     ABI-specific code is a more reasonable place to handle it.  */
