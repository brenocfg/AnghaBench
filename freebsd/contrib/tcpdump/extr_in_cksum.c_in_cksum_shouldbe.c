	 * The value that should have gone into the checksum field
	 * is the negative of the value gotten by summing up everything
	 * *but* the checksum field.
	 *
	 * We can compute that by subtracting the value of the checksum
	 * field from the sum of all the data in the packet, and then
	 * computing the negative of that value.
	 *
	 * "sum" is the value of the checksum field, and "computed_sum"
	 * is the negative of the sum of all the data in the packets,
	 * so that's -(-computed_sum - sum), or (sum + computed_sum).
	 *
	 * All the arithmetic in question is one's complement, so the
	 * addition must include an end-around carry; we do this by
	 * doing the arithmetic in 32 bits (with no sign-extension),
	 * and then adding the upper 16 bits of the sum, which contain
	 * the carry, to the lower 16 bits of the sum, and then do it
	 * again in case *that* sum produced a carry.
	 *
	 * As RFC 1071 notes, the checksum can be computed without
	 * byte-swapping the 16-bit words; summing 16-bit words
	 * on a big-endian machine gives a big-endian checksum, which
	 * can be directly stuffed into the big-endian checksum fields
	 * in protocol headers, and summing words on a little-endian
	 * machine gives a little-endian checksum, which must be
	 * byte-swapped before being stuffed into a big-endian checksum
	 * field.
	 *
	 * "computed_sum" is a network-byte-order value, so we must put
	 * it in host byte order before subtracting it from the
	 * host-byte-order value from the header; the adjusted checksum
	 * will be in host byte order, which is what we'll return.
