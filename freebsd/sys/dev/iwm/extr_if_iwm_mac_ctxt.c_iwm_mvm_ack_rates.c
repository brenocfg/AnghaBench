	 * rates are 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps, we still need to add 1 Mbps
	 * and 6 Mbps because the 802.11-2007 standard says in 9.6:
	 *
	 *    [...] a STA responding to a received frame shall transmit
	 *    its Control Response frame [...] at the highest rate in the
	 *    BSSBasicRateSet parameter that is less than or equal to the
	 *    rate of the immediately previous frame in the frame exchange
	 *    sequence ([...]) and that is of the same modulation class
	 *    ([...]) as the received frame. If no rate contained in the
	 *    BSSBasicRateSet parameter meets these conditions, then the
	 *    control frame sent in response to a received frame shall be
	 *    transmitted at the highest mandatory rate of the PHY that is
	 *    less than or equal to the rate of the received frame, and
	 *    that is of the same modulation class as the received frame.
	 *
	 * As a consequence, we need to add all mandatory rates that are
	 * lower than all of the basic rates to these bitmaps.
