	 * from the GPU has sufficient time to invalidate the CPU cacheline.

	 * the write time to land, but that would incur a delay after every
	 * batch i.e. much more frequent than a delay when waiting for the
	 * interrupt (with the same net latency).
	 *
	 * Also note that to prevent whole machine hangs on gen7, we have to
	 * take the spinlock to guard against concurrent cacheline access.
