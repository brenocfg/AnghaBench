	 * General notes on concurrent page splits and page deletion:
	 *
	 * Routines like _bt_search() don't require *any* page split interlock
	 * when descending the tree, including something very light like a buffer
	 * pin. That's why it's okay that we don't either.  This avoidance of any
	 * need to "couple" buffer locks is the raison d' etre of the Lehman & Yao
	 * algorithm, in fact.
	 *
	 * That leaves deletion.  A deleted page won't actually be recycled by
	 * VACUUM early enough for us to fail to at least follow its right link
	 * (or left link, or downlink) and find its sibling, because recycling
	 * does not occur until no possible index scan could land on the page.
	 * Index scans can follow links with nothing more than their snapshot as
	 * an interlock and be sure of at least that much.  (See page
	 * recycling/RecentGlobalXmin notes in nbtree README.)
	 *
	 * Furthermore, it's okay if we follow a rightlink and find a half-dead or
	 * dead (ignorable) page one or more times.  There will either be a
	 * further right link to follow that leads to a live page before too long
	 * (before passing by parent's rightmost child), or we will find the end
	 * of the entire level instead (possible when parent page is itself the
	 * rightmost on its level).

	 * No ShareLock held case -- why it's safe to proceed.
	 *
	 * Problem:
	 *
	 * We must avoid false positive reports of corruption when caller treats
	 * item returned here as an upper bound on target's last item.  In
	 * general, false positives are disallowed.  Avoiding them here when
	 * caller is !readonly is subtle.
	 *
	 * A concurrent page deletion by VACUUM of the target page can result in
	 * the insertion of items on to this right sibling page that would
	 * previously have been inserted on our target page.  There might have
	 * been insertions that followed the target's downlink after it was made
	 * to point to right sibling instead of target by page deletion's first
	 * phase. The inserters insert items that would belong on target page.
	 * This race is very tight, but it's possible.  This is our only problem.
	 *
	 * Non-problems:
	 *
	 * We are not hindered by a concurrent page split of the target; we'll
	 * never land on the second half of the page anyway.  A concurrent split
	 * of the right page will also not matter, because the first data item
	 * remains the same within the left half, which we'll reliably land on. If
	 * we had to skip over ignorable/deleted pages, it cannot matter because
	 * their key space has already been atomically merged with the first
	 * non-ignorable page we eventually find (doesn't matter whether the page
	 * we eventually find is a true sibling or a cousin of target, which we go
	 * into below).
	 *
	 * Solution:
	 *
	 * Caller knows that it should reverify that target is not ignorable
	 * (half-dead or deleted) when cross-page sibling item comparison appears
	 * to indicate corruption (invariant fails).  This detects the single race
	 * condition that exists for caller.  This is correct because the
	 * continued existence of target block as non-ignorable (not half-dead or
	 * deleted) implies that target page was not merged into from the right by
	 * deletion; the key space at or after target never moved left.  Target's
	 * parent either has the same downlink to target as before, or a <
	 * downlink due to deletion at the left of target.  Target either has the
	 * same highkey as before, or a highkey < before when there is a page
	 * split. (The rightmost concurrently-split-from-target-page page will
	 * still have the same highkey as target was originally found to have,
	 * which for our purposes is equivalent to target's highkey itself never
	 * changing, since we reliably skip over
	 * concurrently-split-from-target-page pages.)
	 *
	 * In simpler terms, we allow that the key space of the target may expand
	 * left (the key space can move left on the left side of target only), but
	 * the target key space cannot expand right and get ahead of us without
	 * our detecting it.  The key space of the target cannot shrink, unless it
	 * shrinks to zero due to the deletion of the original page, our canary
	 * condition.  (To be very precise, we're a bit stricter than that because
	 * it might just have been that the target page split and only the
	 * original target page was deleted.  We can be more strict, just not more
	 * lax.)
	 *
	 * Top level tree walk caller moves on to next page (makes it the new
	 * target) following recovery from this race.  (cf.  The rationale for
	 * child/downlink verification needing a ShareLock within
	 * bt_downlink_check(), where page deletion is also the main source of
	 * trouble.)
	 *
	 * Note that it doesn't matter if right sibling page here is actually a
	 * cousin page, because in order for the key space to be readjusted in a
	 * way that causes us issues in next level up (guiding problematic
	 * concurrent insertions to the cousin from the grandparent rather than to
	 * the sibling from the parent), there'd have to be page deletion of
	 * target's parent page (affecting target's parent's downlink in target's
	 * grandparent page).  Internal page deletion only occurs when there are
	 * no child pages (they were all fully deleted), and caller is checking
	 * that the target's parent has at least one non-deleted (so
	 * non-ignorable) child: the target page.  (Note that the first phase of
	 * deletion atomically marks the page to be deleted half-dead/ignorable at
	 * the same time downlink in its parent is removed, so caller will
	 * definitely not fail to detect that this happened.)
	 *
	 * This trick is inspired by the method backward scans use for dealing
	 * with concurrent page splits; concurrent page deletion is a problem that
	 * similarly receives special consideration sometimes (it's possible that
	 * the backwards scan will re-read its "original" block after failing to
	 * find a right-link to it, having already moved in the opposite direction
	 * (right/"forwards") a few times to try to locate one).  Just like us,
	 * that happens only to determine if there was a concurrent page deletion
	 * of a reference page, and just like us if there was a page deletion of
	 * that reference page it means we can move on from caring about the
	 * reference page.  See the nbtree README for a full description of how
	 * that works.
