	 * children.  Together, they represent the part of the key space that
	 * belongs to each page in the index.  For example, all children of the
	 * root page will have negative infinity as a lower bound from root
	 * negative infinity downlink, and positive infinity as an upper bound
	 * (implicitly, from "imaginary" positive infinity high key in root).
