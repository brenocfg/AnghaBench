	 * newly-created table is really small, even if it currently is, because
	 * that may not be true once some data gets loaded into it.  Once a vacuum
	 * or analyze cycle has been done on it, it's more reasonable to believe
	 * the size is somewhat stable.
	 *
	 * (Note that this is only an issue if the plan gets cached and used again
	 * after the table has been filled.  What we're trying to avoid is using a
	 * nestloop-type plan on a table that has grown substantially since the
	 * plan was made.  Normally, autovacuum/autoanalyze will occur once enough
	 * inserts have happened and cause cached-plan invalidation; but that
	 * doesn't happen instantaneously, and it won't happen at all for cases
	 * such as temporary tables.)
	 *
	 * We approximate "never vacuumed" by "has relpages = 0", which means this
	 * will also fire on genuinely empty relations.  Not great, but
	 * fortunately that's a seldom-seen case in the real world, and it
	 * shouldn't degrade the quality of the plan too much anyway to err in
	 * this direction.
	 *
	 * If the table has inheritance children, we don't apply this heuristic.
	 * Totally empty parent tables are quite common, so we should be willing
	 * to believe that they are empty.
