	 * cache-overflowed flag instead.  This forces readers to look in
	 * pg_subtrans to map subtransaction XIDs up to top-level XIDs. There is a
	 * race-condition window, in that the new XID will not appear as running
	 * until its parent link has been placed into pg_subtrans. However, that
	 * will happen before anyone could possibly have a reason to inquire about
	 * the status of the XID, so it seems OK.  (Snapshots taken during this
	 * window *will* include the parent XID, so they will deliver the correct
	 * answer later on when someone does have a reason to inquire.)
