     * To get the min score we just use the initial hash value left
     * shifted enough to get the 52 bit value. Later we increment the
     * 6 bit prefis (see the hash.bits++ statement), and get the new
     * prefix: 101011, which we align again to 52 bits to get the maximum
     * value (which is excluded from the search). So we get everything
